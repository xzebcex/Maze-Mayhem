# Maze Mayhem
## Description
In the straightforward text-based game Maze Mayhem, the player must make their way through a maze populated by robots. The player must deceive the robots into smashing into each other or dead robots in order to escape capture because they are designed to advance directly towards them despite being barred by barriers. The teleporter in the game enables speedy transitions between different labyrinth sections, but excessive use of it might drain the player's energy. After the player has either deceived every robot into crashing or has been captured by a robot, the game is over.
